# **ProceduralRails**

Java demonstration of procedurally generated 2D rail track over a triangle lattice grid.

Features: 
- Straight and curved track segments.

- Connections/junctions.

- Configurable dimensions for sleepers, rails, and trackbed.

- Basic animation system.

The project can be run by cloning the repo and executing the [demo](https://github.com/DM-UK/ProceduralRails/blob/master/src/main/java/proceduralrails/ProceduralRailsDemo.java).

A more technical description on the drawing of curves is provided [here](TECHNICAL.md).
